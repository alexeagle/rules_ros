## Releasing

Releases are automated on a cron trigger.
The new version is determined automatically from the commit history, assuming the commit messages follow conventions, using
https://github.com/marketplace/actions/conventional-commits-versioner-action.
If you do nothing, eventually the newest commits will be released automatically as a patch or minor release.
This automation is defined in .github/workflows/tag.yaml.

Rather than wait for the cron event, you can trigger manually. Navigate to
https://github.com/mvukov/rules_ros/actions/workflows/tag.yaml
and press the "Run workflow" button.

If you need control over the next release version, for example when making a release candidate for a new major,
then: tag the repo and push the tag, for example

```sh
% git fetch
% git tag v1.0.0-rc0 origin/main
% git push origin v1.0.0-rc0
```

Then watch the automation run on GitHub actions which creates the release.
